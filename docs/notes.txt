image builder
-------------
https://blog.laczik.org/create-custom-openwrt-image-for-tp-link-tl-wa901ndv2/
https://forum.archive.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=52552 -- I might be doing
something wrong, but I don't manage to get the ipkg included in the image...
(other packages like tor, tinc etc do work).

for now, the "add-files.sh" hack does work well enough for me, so I'll look
into this later.

sysupgrade
----------
https://openwrt.org/toh/gl.inet/gl.inet_gl-mt300n_v2#terminal_upgrade_process

NOTE if you have some custom modifications you dont want to lose, you can add
     them to /etc/sysupgrade.conf

export IMG=openwrt-ramips-mt76x8-glinet_gl-mt300n-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin
scp bin/targets/ramips/mt76x8/$IMG root@router:/tmp/
ssh root@router "sysupgrade $IMG"

NOTE sysupgrade -v -n # -n option for NOT preserving configs -> will wipe
     everything, including configs / network etc.

adblock
------------
WIP: (seems like it's working)

# i should see if the intervention can be reduced to a minimum
# ie, useAdBlock=true -> and execute startup script or something.

opkg update
opkg --force-overwrite install gawk grep sed
uci set simple-adblock.config.enabled='1'; uci commit simple-adblock;
/etc/init.d/simple-adblock start
